This pack contains the following folders:

- "3d meshes" - Contains the 3d models imported.

- "Prefabs" - Contains all the prefabs of the models. These prefabs are using their materials, have colliders and are all static.

- "Materials" - Contains one material used in all the prefabs ("Mat_ColorAtlas"), 1 material used in the windows and balcony door ("Mat_Window") and 1 skybox material used for the background color of all the scenes ("Mat_Skybox").

- "Textures" - Contains 1 texture atlas used for the material "Mat_ColorAtlas". This texture has a size of 64x64 pixels.

- "Scenes" - contains 2 scenes: "Scn_AllAssets" and "Scn_Demo". The scene "Scn_AllAssets" contains all the assets organized in a grid. The scene "Scn_Demo" contains a few interiors mounted with the prefabs.


How to setup your own scene:

1 - Use the prefabs on the folder "prefabs".

3 - Mount them however you want in the scene.

4 - Apply changes to the prefabs however you want (Rigidbodies, scripts, etc.)

5 - Do your own Post-processing or feel free to use the one in "Scn_Demo".

IMPORTANT:

You'll need to have the Post Processing Stack installed on your Unity Editor in order to be able to see the Post Processing of the scene "Scn_Demo". In order to do this, follow the next steps:
Go to Window --> Package Manager.  Search "Post Processing" and install it.

How to use Post-processing in other scenes:

1 - Go to your main-camera and add the component: Post-process Layer. If it doesn't appear, you'll have to go to: Window --> Package Manager. Search "Post Processing" and install it.
It should now appear.

2 - In the component, choose the layer "Post Processing". If you can't find one, just create it by going to the layer selection on the top right corner, and choosing "Add layer".

3 - add an Anti-aliasing mode of your choice (I advise "Fast approximate Anti-aliasing (FXAA)").

4 - In the hierarchy window, create a Post-process Volume (in the "3d objects" tab), go to the inspector window and search for a profile. Make sure "Is global" is checked. Change the layer of this object to the layer you added in step 2.

To do your own Post-Processing, just do the same steps, but in the end, create your own profile. Then, you can just add the effects to that component.
